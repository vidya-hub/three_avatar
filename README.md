# 3D Avatar Expression Capture

This project demonstrates how to capture facial expressions from a webcam and apply them to a 3D avatar model in real time using MediaPipe, TensorFlow.js, and Three.js.

## Prerequisites

- A modern web browser that supports WebGL.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vidya-hub/three_avatar.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd three_avatar
   ```

3. Start the application using Live Server.

4. Access the application in your browser. Live Server will provide you with the URL.

5. Allow access to your webcam when prompted.

6. Observe how the 3D avatar model mimics your facial expressions in real time.

## Features

- Real-time facial expression capture using a webcam.
- Application of expressions to a 3D avatar model.
- Uses MediaPipe for face landmark detection.
- Uses Three.js for 3D rendering.
